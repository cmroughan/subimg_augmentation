# subimg_augmentation

This repository will contain the code for extracting polygonal segmentation data from ALTO XML files to use in subimage augmentation, as presented in "Evaluating Augmented Training Data for Complex Document Layouts: the Case of Arabic Scientific Manuscripts" (DH2024). The present version of the code lives in experimental Jupyter notebooks -- this will be refined and then shared here.
